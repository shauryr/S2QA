       "According to the available sources, caffeine has effects on sleep and wakefulness. The studies suggest that caffeine can delay the onset of sleepiness and cause sleep disturbances, as it is an adenosine antagonist and inhibits some hormones that promote sleep (Source 2). Caffeine intake late in the evening can also cause the switch from wake to sleep to occur later than if no caffeine was present in the system (Source 5). However, it is important to note that the effects of caffeine on sleep may vary depending on individual factors such as dose, timing, and sensitivity. Additionally, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to validate the models proposed for incorporating caffeine's impact on sleep (Source 3 and 5)."
